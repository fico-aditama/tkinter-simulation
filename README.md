- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://fico-aditama/tkinter-simulation.git
cd tkinter-simulation
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python app_christian_pray_simulation.py
```

## Usage üìñ

### Starting the Application
Run the main script to launch the application:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = AdvancedPrayerAnimation()
    app.add_keyboard_shortcuts()
    app.add_menu()
    app.mainloop()
```

### Controls

- **Escape**: Exit application
- **H**: View prayer history
- Mouse controls for UI interaction

### Interface Elements
- **Main Window**: Displays the church environment and praying character
- **Control Panel**: Contains buttons and sliders for interaction
- **Statistics Panel**: Shows prayer duration and count

## Customization üé®

### Modifying Prayer Texts
You can customize the prayer texts by modifying the `prayers` list in the code:
```python
self.prayers = [
    "Your prayer line 1",
    "Your prayer line 2",
    # Add more lines as needed
]
```

### Visual Customization
Adjust colors and dimensions in the initialization:
```python
# Change background color
self.canvas.configure(bg='#YOUR_COLOR_CODE')

# Modify window size
self.geometry("WIDTH x HEIGHT")
```

## Key Files üìÅ

- `app_christian_pray_simulation.py`: Main application file
- `prayer_stats.txt`: Stores prayer statistics
- `sounds/`: Directory containing sound effects (optional)

## Technical Details üîß

### Architecture
- Built using Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Tkinter for GUI components
- Custom animation and particle systems
- File-based data persistence

### Performance Considerations
- Optimized particle system for smooth performance
- Efficient animation calculations
